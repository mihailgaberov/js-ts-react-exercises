## 1. What is a Middleware in JS

In the context of JavaScript, particularly in Node.js and Express.js, middleware refers to a software design pattern that enables functions to be executed sequentially, processing incoming requests and outgoing responses. Middleware functions act as an intermediary layer between the client and the server, allowing for:

Request modification: Modifying request objects (req) before they reach the final route handler or endpoint.
Response modification: Modifying response objects (res) before sending them back to the client.
Error handling: Catching and handling errors that occur during request processing.
Authentication and authorization: Verifying user credentials and permissions.
Logging and auditing: Recording request and response data for monitoring and debugging purposes.
Caching: Storing frequently accessed data to improve performance.
Data transformation: Converting data formats or performing calculations.
Middleware functions in JavaScript typically follow this signature:

```javascript
(req, res, next) => {
  // Code to execute
  next(); // Call the next middleware function in the chain
};
```

`req` represents the incoming request object.
`res` represents the outgoing response object.
`next` is a function that passes control to the next middleware function in the chain.

Middleware functions can be:

Built-in: Provided by the Express.js framework, such as express.json() for parsing JSON requests.
Third-party: Imported from npm packages, such as body-parser for parsing request bodies.
Custom: Written by developers to perform specific tasks.
By chaining multiple middleware functions together, you can create a flexible and modular request-processing pipeline. This enables you to:

Implement cross-cutting concerns, such as authentication and logging, in a centralized manner.
Reuse middleware functions across different routes and applications.
Easily add or remove middleware functions as needed.
In summary, middleware in JavaScript is a software design pattern that enables functions to be executed sequentially, processing requests and responses, and providing a flexible and modular approach to request processing in Node.js and Express.js applications.
